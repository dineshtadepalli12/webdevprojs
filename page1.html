              <p>Using Python, various meaningful visualizations have been plotted. Depending on the attributes, appropriate libraries have been used like Altair, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Below images are a few of those visualisations implemented using Python.</p>

            <ul class="images">
              <li><img src="/images/worldmap.jpg" alt="World map"></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In the above visualization, Firstly, total covid deaths in each country has been plotted on the world map to understand if there any areas which recorded Covid deaths in the large number. If any such areas are identified, then one can explore what factors are common in those regions and further analyse them. The total Covid deaths per country is plotted on the world map with the help of Plotly library in Python.
            </p>
            <ul class="images">
                <li><img src="/images/continents.jpg" alt="Box plot"></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Inorder to understand how the covid deaths are distributed across continents, A box plot is plotted by using total deaths per million values on y axis and continent value on x axis. Box plot has been used as it gives information about outliers, median, interquartile range for each continent.
