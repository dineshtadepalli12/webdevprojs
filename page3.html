              <p>Using Python, various meaningful visualizations have been plotted. Depending on the attributes, appropriate libraries have been used like Altair, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Below images are a few of those visualisations implemented using Python.</p>

            <ul class="images">
              <li><img src="/images/popdensity.jpg" alt="Population Density VS total deaths per million"></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Population density is also widely regarded as an important contributor to the spread of Covid. The population density is categorized into three categories high, medium and low density depending on the population density value in the dataset. It can be observed from the above displayed image that “total deaths per million” value is higher in lower density region compared to high and medium density. High and medium density have almost similar value.

            <ul class="images">
                <li><img src="/images/hospital beds.jpg" alt="Beds availability"></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Lm plot for “total deaths per million”, “hospital beds per thousand”, country category and 
                “hdi category” constructed using seaborn.
                As hospital beds got increased as we move towards the right side on x axis, so does the deaths per million except in two instances on the higher income plot. We can see two points having near to 12 beds both these points had lower Deaths per thousand values. An interesting observation is that there is no lower HDI countries in Higher income plot.
