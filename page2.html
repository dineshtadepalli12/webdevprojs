              <p>Using Python, various meaningful visualizations have been plotted. Depending on the attributes, appropriate libraries have been used like Altair, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Below images are a few of those visualisations implemented using Python.</p>

            <ul class="images">
              <li><img src="/images/hexplot.jpg" alt="Median age vs deaths"></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As the points in the area of hex plot increase, the hex will start turn dark. The Hex with less number of scatter points inside is light in color where as the Hex which has more number of scatter points inside is darker in color, because of this it can be quickly understood by viewers who want an overview.
            </p>
            <ul class="images">
                <li><img src="/images/income.jpg" alt="Low vs High income"></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The above plot is constructed using python library called seaborn. We used this plot as we wanted to plot categorical values with quantitative values, Here we can observe the continent and Income status is categorical values and total deaths is quantitative value. We can see the records of the countries in the continent they are present in along with color based on the income status. Each record in the data frame is plotted on the graph, we can see the outliers in each continent and how many records are present along with their deaths per million and income status.
